class ResidualNetwork:
    def __init__(self):
        """
        This is an __init__ method of a ResidualNetwork class which is used to define the residual network of a Flow
            Network. In this method I defined the instance variables security (vertex of all securities), company
            (vertex of all companies), sec_day_shift (vertex of all securities and respective shifts for each day),
            comp_day_shift (vertex of all companies and respective shifts for each day), day  (vertex of all securities
            and days) as an empty list and variables begin, source, end, sink as None as well as setting the initial
            sum to 0.
        I decided to use a Residual Network with the Flow Network as it can keep track of the flows and capacities for
            the network by finding the augmented paths with final max flow from the source and sink using an efficient
            algorithm, bfs using the approach of ford fulkerson.

        Time complexity:

            Worst case analysis: O(1), where the operation involves the assignment of instance variables with None
                and initialization of empty lists
        Space complexity:
            Input space analysis: O(1), where the input consists of a char and a string which has a complexity of O(1)
            Aux space analysis: O(1), where the auxiliary space is used for initialization of an empty lists and
                instance variables

        """
        This is a bfs method of a ResidualNetwork class which finds the shortest path from the source to the target
            of the residual network, sink. Once the shortest path is obtained the bfs is terminated. This method
            is called from the ford fulkerson method of the flow network to find the augmenting path from the source to
            sink such that the max flow from the source to sink can be identified. Since bfs uses the shortest path
            approach, this ensures that the augmenting path always have the minimum number of edges thus assisting
            in ensuring the complexity of ford fulkerson remains efficient. The augmented shortest path are identified
            by storing the previous edges from the source in the variables special_edges which can be used to back track
            from the sink to obtain the augmented path

        Precondition:
            - The vertex and edges for the residual network has already been added
        Postcondition:
            - terminate when the target is reached from the source
            - update the distance variable of the residual network

        Input
            - source: The node instance for the source of the flow network
            - target: The node instance for the sink of the flow network
        Return:
            True/False indicating if the bfs has reached the target or not respectively

        Time complexity:
            Best case analysis: Same as the worst case
            Worst case analysis: O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. This is because
            in the worst case, we will traverse through all the vertices from source to sink and since each vertex has
            its own corresponding edges, so for each vertex each of the edges are traversed to get the corresponding
            "to" vertex. Since in our network flow, in total for all the Vertices, we have E edges and the edges will
            be traversed E times in the worse case when all vertices are traversed, the complexity becomes an addition
            of V and E

        Space complexity:
            Input space analysis: O(1), where the input consists of the instances of the source and target instances
            Aux space analysis: O(V), where V is the number of vertices in the flow network. This is because the bfs
                can run form the source to the sink through all vertices in the worst case, and since we are appending
                the vertices discovered into a list, in worse case we can have  V vertices in the list

        """
        This is a __init__ method that creates a flownetwork and the subsequent residual network instance related
            to teh flownetwork. First I will make a validation check for the __init__ method where I will check if the
            demand of the companies matches the maximum securities available followed by checking if the number of min
            securities working days can match the company demand (check if number of securities required per company is
            lesser than the number of securities available per day) and return None if either conditions are met as they
            are non-feasible. Next this method creates the instances for the source, start, sink and end of the
            flownetwork. Next, a list is created for each security followed by days for a security, followed by
            shifts for a security based on days followed by the shift for the companies and finally a list for the
            companies. Following that edges are created for the flownetwork from the source to the securities (based
            on their min-shift lower bound) and source to the start (based on additional requirement of securities by
            the companies). Next subsequent edges are added between the securities to days, the days to security shifts
            , the security shifts to company shifts and the company shifts to company. Finally, edges with 0 capacity
            from the company is added to the end vertex and edges with capacity of total demand for a company for 30
            days is added to the sink vertex. This creates a complete flownetwork for the problem to determine if the
            allocation is feasible or not and what will the allocation be using ford fulkerson

        Precondition:
            - None
        Postcondition:
            - The flownetwork is created with all vertices and edges connecting from source to sink with a flow and
            capacity with the corresponding residual network

        Input
            pref: A list of list where the outer list represents the number of securities and the inner list represents
                the preference of the securities shifts
            off: A list of list where the outer list represents the number of companies and the inner list represents
                the number of securities required per shift
            min_s: An integer indicating the minimum shifts a security has to work in 30 days
            max_s: An integer indicating the maximum shifts a security can work in 30 days
        Return:
            None

        Time complexity:
            Best case analysis: O(m), where m is the number of companies. This occurs when the minimum number of
                securities shifts is bigger than the companies requirement (where there are securities that
                have not been allocated with their min shifts, but the company has matched the requirements already).
                This results in an early termination where there is no need to create the vertex and edge insstances.
            Worst case analysis: O(m * n), where m is the number of companies and n is the number of securities.
                This is because to create edges between the shifts of the security and the shifts of the company,
                I have to traverse for each of the security to each of the shifts in each company which results in
                the complexity being O(m)*O(n) = O(mn). Although the complexity is O(30*3*n) for each security and
                O(30*3*m) for each company, since 30*3 is a constant value which can be amortized to O(1) these
                complexities will be O(n) and O(m) respectively. Although there are multiple other loop functions, these
                functions either run O(m) times or O(n) times where O(mn) is a dominating complexity


        Space complexity:
            Input space analysis: O(m + n), where m is the number of companies and n is the number of securities.
                Although we have a list in a list for all the companies and securities, but since the internal list is
                a constant value of 3, the complexity will be O(m*3) + O(n*3) = O(3m+3n) = O(m+n)
            Aux space analysis: O(m * n), where m is the number of companies and n is the number of securities.
                This is because after creating the edges between the shifts of the security and the shifts of the
                company, the edges has to be stored in the edges list for each vertex of the shifts of the security.
                Since there will be m*n number of edges in total scaled by a constant 30 or 3*30, so the
                auxiliary space complexity remains as O(mn) as the constants will have a complexity of O(1).
                Furthermore, since creating an edge for vertices in flow network and residual network takes the same
                auxiliary space for each, the auxiliary space will be 2*O(mn) = O(2mn) = O(mn)

            can identify that the ford ferkuson method is complete with the max flow of the network flow.
        To run this method, first we will get an augmenting path from the bfs, next, I will find the minimum distance
            within the augmenting path and update the flownetwork and the residual network with the minimum flow
            identified. Following that I will reset the visited, discovered and past states of the residual network to
            default then I will run the bfs again. The bfs will run again and again until there is no augmenting path.

        Time complexity:
            Best case analysis: Same as the worst case
            Worst case analysis: O(m * n * n), where m is the number of companies and n is the number of securities.
                The worst case complexity of a ford fulkerson is O(VE^2), where V is the number of vertices and E is the
                number of edges. Although for our flow network, E should be approximately V^2, but not in this case,
                where the E will not be V^2 since most of the edges are scaled between the companies and the securities,
                and there is no connection between companies to companies or securities to securities. This ensures that
                the number of edges is dependent on the preferences of the securities, which is why we can see that for
                the edges, it is dominated by the number of securities, n. As for the number of vertices, the dominant
                factor for the number of vertices traversed is the companies themselves as the requirement of the
                companies is what we are trying to fulfill as the demand for the securities. In this case, since the
                dominant factor is the number of companies, the number of vertices visited is scaled by the number of
                companies. This ensures that the worse case time complexity lies between O(mnn). The ford fulkerson has
                to run O(mnn) times since to run bfs, the complexity will O(V + E) = O(m + n), and since a bfs is being
                used to identify the number of times being run, the complexity will be O(VE) = O(mn). Thus, in total,
                since the dominating factor for bfs is scaled by the number of edges, the total complexity = O(mnn).

        Space complexity:
            Input space analysis: O(1), since there is no inputs and the self input values retieved are methods instead
                of variable of lists
            Aux space analysis: O(m), where m is the number of companies. The space complexity of O(m) is required in
                the bfs to store the discovered list that has been traversed and since the remaining operations in ford
                fulkerson involves updating the values only.

def allocate(preferences, officers_per_org, min_shifts, max_shifts):
    """
    This is a allocate method that creates a flownetwork and the subsequent residual network instance related
        to the flownetwork to define the structure of the graph path from the security to the companies. After
        creating the flow and teh residual network, the ford fulkerson method will be run to find the maximum
        flow from teh source to the sink and the update is done on the flow network itself. Next, the edges from the
        source is checked if they have a max flow, if yes then the problem is feasible and we will update the allocation
        list, else, the problem is not feasible and None is returned

        The approach I am planning to use for is to create a Flow Network based on the Circular Lower
            Bound Flows and the corresponding Residual Network for the Flow Network. The Residual Network is initialized
            upon the creation of the FlowNetwork, where I will initialize the Residual Network as an instance variable
            of the Flow Network.The Flow Network is created by creating the vertices for start, source, sink and end as
            well as lists for securities, security_days, security_Shifts, company_shifts and companies while adding
            edges with a flow and capacity to determine the maximum flow through each edge. I will add the edges from
            the vertex of the security to days then days to sec_day_shift then sec_day_shift to comp_day_shift then
            comp_day_shift to company as well as edges from source to security, start to security and companies to sink.
            These edges will also be created concurrently while creating the Residual Network with the instance of
            FlowNetwork passed in as a parameter for the Edges to store these instances. Next I will run the ford
            fulkerson on the residual network which will run the bfs of the Residual Network to get an augmenting path
            continuously to get the flow until no flows exists from the source to sink. This indicates the completion
            of the ford fulkerson method and following that, I will check if the flow is complete (feasible) by
            observing the edges from the source to the securities to check if the flow = capacity for all the edges. If
            they are all equal then it is feasible, else it is not feasible. Finally, based on the resulting flow
            network I will create a list of a list for the allocation of the securities for the companies. For the
            approach of this task, although we will be using n*30*3 number of vertices for the shifts of security and
            m*30*3 number of vertices for the shifts of companies, but since, 30 and 3 are constants, they can be
            considered to be of  O(1) complexity, thus bringing the complexity of creating these vertices to O(n) and
            O(m) respectively

    Precondition:
        - The preferences for the security must be at least one of the shifts
        - The min shift <= max shift and are bounded by 0 and 30 inclusive
    Postcondition:
        - The feasibility of the flow network is identified, if yes, allocation returned, else None returned

    Input
        preferences: A list of list where the outer list represents the number of securities and the inner list
            represents the preference of the securities shifts
        officers_per_org: A list of list where the outer list represents the number of companies and the inner list
            represents the number of securities required per shift
        min_shifts: An integer indicating the minimum shifts a security has to work in 30 days
        max_shifts: An integer indicating the maximum shifts a security can work in 30 days
    Return:
        lst: A list of allocation for each security for each company for each day and each shift
        None: When no allocation exists or the ford fulkerson is not feasible

    Time complexity:
        Best case analysis: O(m), where m is the number of companies. This occurs when the minimum number of
            securities shifts is bigger than the companies requirement (where there are securities that
            have not been allocated with their min shifts, but the company has matched the requirements already).
            This results in an early termination where there is no need to create the vertex and edge instances.
        Worst case analysis: O(m * n * n), where m is the number of companies and n is the number of securities.
            The worst case complexity of a ford fulkerson is O(VE^2), where V is the number of vertices and E is the
            number of edges. Although for our flow network, E should be approximately V^2, but not in this case,
            where the E will not be V^2 since most of the edges are scaled between the companies and the securities,
            and there is no connection between companies to companies or securities to securities. This ensures that
            the number of edges is dependent on the preferences of the securities, which is why we can see that for
            the edges, it is dominated by the number of securities, n. As for the number of vertices, the dominant
            factor for the number of vertices traversed is the companies themselves as the requirement of the
            companies is what we are trying to fulfill as the demand for the securities. In this case, since the
            dominant factor is the number of companies, the number of vertices visited is scaled by the number of
            companies. This ensures that the worse case time complexity of ford fulkerson lies between O(mnn). Since
            the other operations takes a lesser time complexity where creation of vertices takes O(m+n), creation of
            edges taken O(mn), the feasibility checking takes O(n) and the process of creating the allocation list
            takes O(mn), the worst case complexity will be the dominant one which is O(mnn)


    Space complexity:
        Input space analysis: O(m + n), where m is the number of companies and n is the number of securities.
            Although we have a list in a list for all the companies and securities, but since the internal list is
            a constant value of 3, the complexity will be O(m*3) + O(n*3) = O(3m+3n) = O(m+n)
        Aux space analysis: O(m * n), where m is the number of companies and n is the number of securities.
            This is because after creating the edges between the shifts of the security and the shifts of the
            company, the edges has to be stored in the edges list for each vertex of the shifts of the security.
            Since there will be m*n number of edges in total scaled by a constant of 3 or 30, so the
            auxiliary space complexity remains as O(mn)
